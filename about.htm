                    People with disability are the most vulnerable and
                    marginalized group of people. They live in isolation,
                    segregation, disparagement, poverty and virtual dependence
                    on charity and even pity. They are the victim of the
                    community misconception and stigmas denying them of their
                    inalienable and recognized rights. As a result, they shut
                    themselves from the world and they underestimate themselves
                    thinking that they do not fit in the society like other
                    able-bodied children.<br />

                    Thus, it becomes a painful reality how there is limited
                    involvement or we can find no involvement of their parents
                    or guardians in formulation and implementation of the
                    policies related to them. In addition, the programs
                    introduced by the Government have not benefitted them much.
                    Therefore, non-governmental organizations have been
                    providing care and different needed support activities
                    targeting people with disabilities.<br />

                    Conflict Victim and Disable Society (CVDS-Nepal) is one of
                    these non- profit organizations located at Shankarapur
                    Municipality-6, Shalambutar,Sankhu,Kathmandu.This
                    organization has been devoting unceasingly with the aim of
                    supporting the people with disability in Nepal since 2005.
                    The organization has been providing food, clothes, shelter,
                    basic care and support to till date mentally and physically
                    disabled children through the ‘Rehabilitation Center for
                    Children with disability due to Cerebral Palsy (CP)’

                    a remote place of Bhojpur district, Nepal. I am the second
                    child among 6 children (4 sons and 2 daughters) of my
                    parents. I was not only an active and curious sibling but
                    also very good in study. My schooling was started from SHREE

                    house. I often stood first in study in the classes. After I
                    passed class 7 I had to go four hours far from my house on
                    feet to pursue my further education since we did not have
                    high school in our village. When I was admitted to Shree
                    Sagarmatha SECONDARY SCHOOL that time I was only fourteen
                    year old. It was only me going that school from my area
                    which used to lead me going alone finding school friends
                    from only the middle of the path. I used feel often fear
                    going through the jungle and hill where there were many
                    dangerous animal like tigers and beers. due to fear I used
                    to carry a stick with me from my home thinking I could be
                    safe and secured with it. I would not even get money to have
                    my lunch and snacks going to the school. Struggling through
                    hunger, tiredness and thrust coming back home from the
                    school was my normal phenomena. ALTHOUGH my family had
                    enough resource providing a pocket money, I never got money
                    to have my food caused starving time and again. However, I
                    continued my study and passed grade 8. <br />
                    While I was studying in grade 9, unfortunately I developed
                    pain in my backbone. The paining situation went worsen than
                    the worse day by day. I ended up going to school. In remote
                    place, WHERE traditional belief and superstition were highly
                    rooted in the villages in those days. As advices received
                    from our neighbors and friends my family took me to
                    traditional healers for my treatment. They began to take me
                    to them daily-sometimes, one after other persons.
                    Innumerable chickens, Pigeons including vegetables WERE
                    SACRIFICED BUT IT DIDN’T help changing anything in my
                    condition. The more I was taken to traditional healers more
                    my condition got worsen.<br />
                    The reason that I was not taken in to hospital for treatment
                    was strong belief that hospital could not treat such type of
                    disease, cost and distance associated with it. Until then
                    the disease attacked acted more severely. The part of my
                    body over my knees and below my waist started paining. The
                    process to take me to traditional healer didn’t stop so I
                    began to take a stick for walking. After some days my right
                    leg also stuck moving. Then I was in a condition not able to
                    move from a place. When I became paralyzed from moving just
                    sitting in a particular place then only I was carried by a
                    potter up to the place where bus service were connected . My
                    father took me to a private health clinic in Biratnagar,
                    Morang district for treatment. Later IT CAME IN MY KNOWLEDGE
                    that the health clinic was the aryurbhadhik clinic. The
                    doctor gave us some ayurbeddhik medicine saying the medicine
                    would work well. I would have recovered by ninth month by
                    taking the medicine as prescribed. So we came back to home
                    with this medicine and the advice given by the doctor. I
                    returned home carried on a basket by a potter. With the hope
                    of recovery and the relief from the disease, I used to take
                    medicine routinely but the effort went in vain as I couldn’t
                    fell any improvement in my bodily condition. Again I put a
                    proposal fourth requesting my family member to take me to
                    another hospital but the proposal was not heard at all .This
                    situation invited conflict and quarrels everyday between my
                    father and me. I was almost tired with my situation and
                    behavior showed by my father. Finally I decided to suicide
                    myself taking poison. It was the month of July, my father
                    and mother had gone to terai (plain region) to tilde the
                    field and plant the rice. One day, I was with my six years
                    sister who didn’t know what poison was and it worked for.
                    Getting advantage of her innocence I asked her to purchases
                    four pockets of rat killing poison from nearby shop. The
                    poison was stirred in a glass with water and kept it under
                    my pong. I wrote in a paper the agony and givens to wards my
                    family and reason of my decision of suicide and kept it
                    under the pillow. I HAD WRITTEN IN THAT paper that I wanted
                    proper treatment and recover in addition to continue my
                    study and do good thing for the society and my family
                    itself. But my dreams couldn’t be fulfilled. My condition
                    happened to be worsening day by day .therefore I thought
                    leaving my family, friends, relatives and leaving the whole
                    world would be the best freedom for my soul and body. Indeed
                    I had a intimate friend in my neighborhood with whom I often
                    shared my feelings and emotion. He was out of the village at
                    the moment. I wanted to say my last words to him before
                    swallowing off the poison after a couple of days upon his
                    arrival in the village. However, in main time there was a
                    lot of impulse occurring in my mind. In other words, my mind
                    was out of order-I could not sense out well time and again
                    what I spoke out. During this situation, this very secret
                    development was spoken with one of my brothers. One of the
                    neighbors has been informed about the development of mine.
                    He came to me. We had begun the dialogue. During our
                    conversation I said I was hanging at branch of banyan tree.
                    The root of the tree was cut by the mouse. The tree would
                    fall soon. There was a den under the tree. Inside the den
                    there was anaconda sitting looking at me with opened mouth
                    to eat me away. I would fall soon and would be eaten by the
                    anaconda. Neighbor said if I fell in the mouth of the
                    anaconda you would be eaten and would be nice. But if you
                    were fallen other side not at the mouth of the anaconda,
                    then situation would further worsen. Means I would not die
                    through the poison. Then, I realized it might not be the
                    good decision. So I relinquished the idea of the being dead
                    poisoning myself. I replied him positively saying I would
                    not take poison. With this development I was not interested
                    to speak to him further. He kindly advised to throw the
                    poison away and burn the note I had written which done
                    accordingly. The plot ended leaving only one more
                    alternative to venture to Kathmandu for treatment and
                    continue the study. But I didn’t know anything about
                    Kathmandu. To know about it I sent a letter to radio Nepal,
                    only a nationwide radio station functioning in those days,
                    asking a question in one relevant radio broadcasting
                    program. My letter was read in the 19th day I had sent it.
                    When I heard my name with my detail address I was so
                    surprised and thrilled. although I had the radio set quite
                    functioning with me I did not listen my question answer
                    myself directly. When one of the neighbors told me that my
                    question was answered then only I came to know it. They told
                    me that I was suggested to contact Kathmandu Social Welfare
                    Council which would help me. I thought I should go to
                    Kathmandu then but neither did I have money nor I would get
                    help from the family. But I thought to try once asking my
                    father thinking he might agree fulfilling this desire.
                    Hoping I might be able to go to Kathmandu I told him, if he
                    would take me to Kathmandu I would continue my studies apart
                    from improving the physical condition. But he said to me
                    (other son who are fine and have leg didn’t study how will u
                    having no leg study). He also said that to invest money for
                    my studies is like throwing the money in the river. Now I
                    brainstormed what to do. How would I go to Kathmandu
                    achieving my final destination? Thinking like it I bought a
                    chicken and it started growing being bigger day by day and
                    begun laying an eggs and hatching it producing chicken. The
                    process kept on continuously being a good source of earning
                    money by selling them. Apart from chicken I even learnt to
                    play cards inviting people in my house frequently and I
                    didn’t feel alone, too. Playing card was for entertainment
                    as well as gambling. This turned like a good business in my
                    case thereby winning the card earning a 10 to 15 rupee
                    daily. The friends who used to play with me used to say in
                    half way joking manner that "we feel jealous to give you
                    money directly so we are giving you through playing
                    cards."At that time I was able to meet Mr. Balkrishna rai,
                    then leader of Nepal who was from my district. He had come
                    to my house in a connection of his political campaign. I
                    talked with him about my problem and longing to go to
                    Kathmandu. He promises to take me to Kathmandu with him .as
                    he promised finding a good luck day we thought to go to
                    Kathmandu. We searched for a potter. That time my father had
                    gone to terai to harvest the paddy. So we send a message to
                    him writing "your son is going to Kathmandu and if you love
                    him then come home. When my father heard the message this
                    time he immediately came home and we both together went to
                    Kathmandu. When we reached Kathmandu then firstly we went to
                    Bir hospital, one of the oldest government hospitals, where
                    the doctor examined me and told my father to do CT scan
                    which I did not understand properly. But I was told by
                    saying that my disease couldn’t be cure then. Then I went to
                    Khagendra New Life Center, the first residential
                    rehabilitation center for the persons with disability in
                    Nepal located at jorpati, Kathmandu. But there was no place
                    for my accommodation. At the same time I heard that there
                    was a health camp being organized in Nepalgunj (Mid West
                    Nepal) providing free assistive devices for the needy
                    disable people. So I requested my father to capture that
                    opportunity I wanted wheelchair easing my mobility. My
                    father responded conversely saying to go to Kathmandu
                    solving your problem. When we came here you are saying to go
                    to Nepalgunj and when you will go there you may say to go to
                    India. You may finish the little property that I have. We
                    also need to live and your brother, sisters also need to
                    live.) With this statement he returned back to Sunsari
                    District, eastern, Terai where he had owned some land
                    several years before leaving me alone in Kathmandu.<br />
                    BAL Krishna Thapa, then Leader played my hotel cost and
                    purchased a bus ticket and send me to sun sari district.
                    When I reached there again I requested my father to take me
                    to Nepalgunj. Then he agreed to take the ticket to by bus
                    tickets to Nepalgunj. When he went out of the house, the
                    neighbors' told him "your son will waste all your money, if
                    you follow his demands" so he returned back. When he
                    returned home then I scold him and a quarrel began. I
                    scolded the neighbors saying" if u can help then help me if
                    u can't then don’t stop others". After then my father again
                    went to take the ticket and we went to Nepalgunj finally.<br />
                    I collected one wheelchair from the health camp. We came
                    back Sunsari with that wheelchair for me. With help of the
                    wheelchair I improved my mobility there. I admitted a local
                    school and continued my schooling smoothly. When my School
                    Leaving Certificate (slc) examination was over, I was alone;
                    my father had gone to village during those days. so taking
                    advantage of this time I sold 2 quintals of rice and went to
                    Kathmandu with my younger brother, prem Thapa lying that we
                    would be going to visit Kathmandu. In 3 days journey we
                    reached Kathmandu. After reaching here, WE visited to one of
                    the organizations working for the rehabilitation of the
                    persons with disability where medical treatment facility to
                    was available. TO examine myself quickly I requested the
                    phisio therapist, krisha Gurung. But he refused admitting me
                    saying that I would wait more 3 months for my turn. Then I
                    stayed outside with sadness cursing my fate. In the main
                    time,<br />
                    I had seen the visitors coming there would greet the staff
                    by saying (Namaste) and how are you and so on. In return,
                    the welcoming behavior from staff would be showed. But I had
                    just come from village, became shy, didn’t know to say
                    namaste and so forth. Might be it was the reason why the
                    staff didn't come in front of me and didn’t talked with me.
                    so I thought I must be proactive-saying Namaste, how are you
                    ETC. then I told Namaste to one of the foreign volunteers,
                    then she also Replied it and came near to me, sat near me
                    and asked me what was my problem. Then I turned out my story
                    and told that I did not get admission in the hospital. Then
                    immediately she went inside and brought the phios therapy
                    out and requested him to take my admission then krisha
                    Gurung accepted her request and admitted me for 6 months. I
                    thanked her so much. Then my phisio therapy begun and within
                    3 month I was able to move a little. They were also happy
                    and slowly were improving. The result of slc exam came out.
                    I knew that I was fail in English subject. With this result,
                    I did not lose my hope and efforts. So I reappeared the exam
                    too next year and passed SLC, an iron gate for a carrier
                    development here in Nepal. While I completed course of
                    phisio therapy, I engaged to paid work in the same
                    organization to earn little money. I admitted a college
                    nearby to continue my education. But seeing me a disable the
                    public vehicle would not stop while going to college, I use
                    to fall a lot when getting into the vehicle. Fighting this
                    situation I was able to continue college level study for 3
                    years. Then after due to my technical problem I was
                    compelled to discontinue the study. Then we few friends sat
                    together discuss to establish an organization to be run by
                    ourselves. We were able to establish an organization named
                    conflict victim and disable society. This organization has
                    been registered with the local government of Nepal under NGO
                    registration Act. Soon also affiliated with social welfare
                    council's started working as the founder president .in the
                    same year I had an intercaste marriage to very generous
                    lady. A year after we were lucky to have a baby boy. Now he
                    is studying in class 9. ( but corana is distrub now.. he is
                    in home. We realized there are children and adult with
                    intellectual disability and multiple disability severely
                    deprived from opportunity living in a very pathetic
                    condition everywhere across the country. Where will there is
                    is a way. We began this work. Now we have been providing
                    orphans left in the street, kept in house without providing
                    basic facilities and other orphans. We have run a
                    residential rehabilitation facility. A team of 9 staff and
                    staffs have dedicated to support this 50 children till date
